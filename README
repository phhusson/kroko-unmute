This project is a replacement for Kyutai's STT for unmute, with Kroko ASR.
The goal is to use unmute for low latency voice assistant, but with much lower resources than original unmute and its resource-hungry STT/TTS.

A feature of Kyutai's STT is end of turn detection, which Kroko ASR lacks.
Instead, we use a simple rule based on time of latest output token.
Unmute handles being interrupted, so even if the user pauses, the seamless conversation survives.
It is likely to reduce seamless-ness and increase (worsen) voice-to-voice latency.

You can run this with `uv run serve.py`.
Default model is the FR openweight one. To select another, edit the source code
